Or each link below to directly to the corresponding episode:

* [Episode 1 - Series Intro](https://youtu.be/e1zDoR7ODcc)
* [Episode 2 - pyCycle Primer](https://youtu.be/rRHahSH9xD0)
* [Episode 3 - The CF34 Engine](https://youtu.be/4IsCuwDUGC4)

**The pyCycle bug (issue#96) was fixed by PR#106 - so no need to filter out the 19000ft data anymore. File CF34_deck_v4.csv now is complete!**

* [Episode 5 - Results and Lookup Table](https://youtu.be/B1LkqAnTnZ4) / associated files: "episod_5_results_and_lookup_table.ipynb"
* [Episode 6 - Engine Dynamics, Input Shaping and Simulation-ready Code](https://youtu.be/95Gy2wg3olE) / associated file: "episode_6_API.ipynb"

There is a ton of opportunity for improvement and IÂ´d love to hear from you or, even better, put a PR in!

Enjoy!
